# Super Factory Manager Language

This extension provides syntax highlighting for the Super Factory Manager Language (SFM) and a few extras

## Features

- **Syntax highlighting:** For SFM code, similar to in-game text editor.
Colors depends on the theme you are using

- **Snippets:** Basic functionalities that improves code writing, like every snippet or energy snippet.
For now, the following snippets are available: basic, energy, input, output, if, ifelse, ifelseif, every.

- **Folding:** You can hide collapse some structures on your files, like if or every

- **Activity bar:** To activate it, you need to open a workspace folder and then open a .sfm or .sfml. It includes examples, both in-game and from github. Requires Internet connection.

- **Error checking:** It will check the file when saved to check on any erros

- **Warnings:** It will show any input that has no output and viceversa. It might not work as well in some cases (check the changelog)

- **Share your work with others:** Activity bar has now a third tab for external urls (only GitHub and only .sfml and .sfm and folders) and local folders

- **Settings:** Customizations! You can add more content or change some behaviors from the default ones

## Installation

1. Install the extension through the VSCode Marketplace.

By now, you have almost everything to start, just need some imagination.
We made some changes on the generated files to make it compile. Just 2 small changes because of `@lexer::members {
    public boolean INCLUDE_UNUSED = false; // we want syntax highlighting to not break on unexpected tokens
}` on the .g4

### 5. Pull request

Make a pull request to the original repo. Make sure it doesnt break anything that was before.
