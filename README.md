## About

Super Factory Manager is a mod for Minecraft that lets users create programs to run their factories. The mod provides a domain specific language tailored for moving items, fluids, and other resource types. A text editor is included, along with example programs.

To get started, you will need a factory manager, a label gun, and a disk.

## Release process

The following process is designed to catch the most obvious problems that may arise from creating a new release.

```
versions = [1.19.2, 1.19.4, 1.20, 1.20.1]
jars = []
for i,version in enumerate(versions):
    git checkout $version
    gradle genIntellijRuns
    if i == 0:
        make changes
        bump mod_version in gradle.properties
        update changelog.sfml example
        git commit
        git push
    else:
        git merge $versions[i-1]
        resolve conflicts
    runData
    git add src/generated
    rm -rf runGameTest/world
    gradle runGameTestServer, assert exit == 0
    gradle build | jars.append($_)

git push --all

for jar in jars:
    copy jar to server, run.bat
    copy jar to prism launcher, launch
    connect to server
    assemble a simple program, assert works

for jar in jars:
    upload jar to curseforge with changelog
```

## Optimization

There's some neat tricks used to improve the performance of the mod, here's an overview :D

### Minimum Tick Rate

The minimum timer interval of 1 second makes crappy programs 20x more performant since they aren't running every
tick.

### Pattern Caching

![map from string to lambda](media/pattern%20cache.png)

Be not afraid, regular expressions are only used when necessary.

![string equals used when possible](media/predicate%20builder.png)

---

Using the `EACH` keyword to count by type rather than by matcher also employs a cache.

```sfm
EVERY 20 TICKS DO
    INPUT 2 EACH *ingot* FROM a
    OUTPUT TO b
END
```

This program will internally enumerate the registry to create a separate tracker for each resource type.

### Object Pooling

```sfm
EVERY 20 TICKS DO
    INPUT FROM a
    OUTPUT TO b
END
```

When many inventories are involved, this can quickly result in a lot of objects being created when the program runs.

My testing shows that object pooling provides a slight increase in performance, even if there's only tens of thousands
of objects involved.

### Testing

I created a custom barrel block used only for testing. Running all the game tests for the mod creates 2,866 barrel
blocks.
Many of those barrels are so full of items that when I clear or restart the tests it causes 27,310 stacks to be dropped
on the ground.

By creating a custom barrel that doesn't drop the inventory contents, the friction of doing more tests is reduced!

### User Empowerment

```sfm
NAME "first"
EVERY 20 TICKS DO
    INPUT FROM a
    OUTPUT TO b
END
```

```sfm
NAME "second"
EVERY 20 TICKS DO
    INPUT stone, iron_ingot FROM a
    OUTPUT TO b
END
```

Which program is more efficient? idk. Use the performance graph and compare.

Cool. Looks like the first one is twice as fast. Maybe you need to filter items though? Maybe the outcome is different
if depending on the inventories?

Rather than trying to prescribe a best approach based on how I know the mod works, it's better to directly give the
players the tools needed to perform experiments to find out what works best in their scenario.
